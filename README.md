# Web Development Projects

A collection of web development projects I've worked on.

## Viewing the Projects

### Static Projects
To view the following projects:
- `BasicPracticeDisplayingWithBootstrap`
- `MoviesReviewing`
- `MidtermProject`

Open them in **VS Code** and use the **Live Server** extension to preview the pages in your browser.

### React & Node.js Projects
The other projects were built using **React** and **Node.js**. To view these:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate into the project folder.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
